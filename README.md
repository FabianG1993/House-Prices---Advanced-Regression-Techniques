House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting

You have some experience with R or Python and machine learning basics. This is a perfect competition for data science students who have completed an online course in machine learning and are looking to expand their skill set before trying a featured competition. 

Goal:
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

Metric:
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)

Submission File Format:
The file should contain a header and have the following format: Id,SalePrice
